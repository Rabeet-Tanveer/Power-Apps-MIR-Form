# Power-Apps-MIR-Form

Digitilization of a form on word using Power Apps with connection to a Sharepoint Database for information storage and retrieval. The App is calibrated to show 2 views, one if it has been opened for creation of a new entry and one if it has been opened for review. Submission of the form generated a entry in the database that starts a Cloud Automation in Power Automate for approval of the form and its action plan from various supervisors. Finally a report dashboard is created in Power BI to generate a yearly report regarding the MIR Forms filled.
